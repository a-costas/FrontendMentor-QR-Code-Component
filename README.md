## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./images/qr-code-screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've been looking for an opportunity to try using CSS variables as well as using HSL over Hex.
It's something I want to continue using in the future, I think that when working with themes (i.e. primary and secondary color schemes or typography) using both of these could come in very handy to make big changes fast across an entire page.

I also wanted to try being mindful of accessibility needs.

```css
:root {
  --Dark-Navy: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
  --Grey: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  --Light-Grey: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --Main-font: "Outfit";
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on writing accessible code as well as scalable code.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools Color Converter](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp) - I used this to convert hex colors from the Figma docs into HSL
